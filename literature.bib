  title = {The \{ULTIMATE\} conservative difference scheme applied to unsteady
	one-dimensional advection },
  journal = {Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering },
  year = {1991},
  volume = {88},
  pages = {17 - 74},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Modeling of highly advective transport is embarrassingly difficult,
	even in the superficially simple case of one-dimensional constant-velocity
	flow. In this paper, a fresh approach is taken, based on an explicit
	conservative control-volume formulation that makes use of a universal
	limiter for transient interpolation modeling of the advective transport
	equations. This ‘ULTIMATE’ conservative difference scheme is applied
	to unsteady, one-dimensional scalar pure advection at constant velocity,
	using three representative test profiles: a discontinuous step, an
	isolated sine-squared wave, and a semi-ellipse. The goal is to devise
	a single robust scheme which achieves sharp monotonic resolution
	of the step without corrupting the other profiles. The semi-ellipse
	is particularly challenging because of its combination of sudden
	and gradual changes in gradient. The \{ULTIMATE\} strategy can be
	applied to explicit conservative advection schemes of any order of
	accuracy. Second-order methods are shown to be unsatisfactory because
	of steepening and clipping typical of currently popular so-called
	‘high resolution’ shock-capturing or \{TVD\} schemes. The \{ULTIMATE\}
	third-order upwind scheme is highly satisfactory for most flows of
	practical importance. Higher order methods give predictably better
	step resolution, although even-order schemes generate a (monotonic)
	waviness in the difficult semi-ellipse simulation. By using adaptive
	stencil expansion to introduce (in principle arbitrarily) higher
	order resolution locally in isolated regions of high curvature or
	high gradient, extremely accurate coarse-grid results can be obtained
	with very little additional cost above that of the base (third-order)
	scheme. },

  title = {A stable and accurate convective modelling procedure based on quadratic
	upstream interpolation },
  journal = {Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering },
  year = {1979},
  volume = {19},
  pages = {59 - 98},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {A convective modelling procedure is presented which avoids the stability
	problems of central differencing while remaining free of the inaccuracies
	of numerical diffusion associated with upstream differencing. For
	combined convection and diffusion the number of operations at each
	grid point is comparable to that of standard upstream-pluscentral
	differencing — however, highly accurate solutions can be obtained
	with a grid spacing much larger than that required by conventional
	methods for comparable accuracy, with obvious practical advantaged
	in terms of both speed and storage. The algorithm is based on a conservative
	control-volume formulation with cell wall values of each field variable
	written in terms of a quadratic interpolation using in any one coordinate
	direction the two adjacent nodal values together with the value at
	the next upstream node. This results in a convective differencing
	scheme with greater formal accuracy than central differencing while
	retaining the basic stable convective sensitivity property of upstream-weighted
	schemes. The consistent treatment of diffusion terms is equivalent
	to central differencing. With careful modelling, numerical boundary
	conditions are not troublesome. Some idealized problems are studied,
	showing the practical advantages of the method over other schemes
	in comparison with exact solutions. An application to a complex unsteady
	two-dimensional flow is briefly discussed. },
